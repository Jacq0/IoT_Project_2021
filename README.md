# Proposal:

## Smart Plant Garden System
#### Student Name: *Jack Fitzpatrick*   Student ID: *20090266*

A small but smart system for growing plants in a bed, something akin to a small greenhouse or plantbed. Alternatively: A small Hydroponics system for growing plants. (This system could be adapted into an Aquaponics system with some small changes and the addition of a fish tank)

The system would monitor things like light levels, temperatures, water levels, moisture and PH. Using this data it will decide when to take actions and what to do, such as watering or switching on and off lights/pumps at certain intervals. The system would notify the user of events and allow the users to remotely monitor the plants or even see them (Provided some sort of camera is used) and control the system. Ideally this system would operate without any user input and with very little supervision!

Both these systems are mentioned as they are both very similar in scope and require essentially the same equiptment. The concept is the same for both of them: monitor and manage plants, take actions relating to the data and communicate it to the user.

### Tools, Technologies and Equipment

TODO: Write a list of things you propose to use in your work. This can be hardware, programming languages etc.

- Raspberry Pi and/or Arduino
- Python/JavaScript
- Servos
- Temperature Sensors
- Moisture/Water Sensors
- Growing Light
- Light Sensor
- Pump
- PH Meter
- Camera (Possibly)
- Mobile Phone or Laptop (Remote monitoring)
